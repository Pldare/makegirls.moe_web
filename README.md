This repo contains the front-end part of [make.girls.moe](http://make.girls.moe/).

We decide to open-source model training scripts after the release of Chainer 3.0. Since Chainer do not support gradient norm function currently, we use some tricks in the training. 
Also, my personal repo [Chainer-GANs](https://github.com/Aixile/chainer-gan-experiments) contains some necessary references for reproducing our results.
